                    <p>The act of smartphone-based voice chatting is an important element of many interpersonal activities, especially for people who have close relationships but do not live in the same physical space. However, The emotional atmosphere of
                        the ecstasy moment in an intimate relationship is said to be tangible with the feeling of touch. Language is sometimes too pale to convey the inner feelings and the love towards the loved person. In this case, there is a missed
                        opportunity to translate voice chatting into haptic experience, giving people a real sense of accompany.

                        <h4>Microphone PCB Design</h4>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        I used SVG-PCB to design the PCB for microphone in this final project. SVG-PCB is an in-browser editor lets users design Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) from a code description. Because I already tried this in <a href="hw5.html">Week5-Electronics Design</a>,
                        I feel comfortable to use this tool now. By referencing the PCB design in <a href="mic/hello.mic.45">hello.mic.45</a>, I started to design my own microphone PCB. Considering the small area in smartphone case, the main goal of this
                        design is to reduce the size of the PCB. In this case, I tried to understand what is the smallest electronic unit to do what I want.
                    </p>

                    </p>

                    The next step is to use SVG-PCB to design the PCB that could be printed. When arranging, I also tried to make each part compact to reduce the area of the entire PCB.

                    <p>
                        Then I go the CBA lab, and would like to print it. The biggest issue I met in <a href="hw5.html">Week5-Electronics Design</a> is that I don't know the doi of the png file. But with the experience I had last time, I quickly set
                        up the doi to 1000 this time. But this time I ran into a new problem. After I started the machine, even though I started the command line, the machine still didn't connect. Ozgun helped me deal with that. And very unexpectedly,
                        near the end, I encountered a small incident. When the printing was over, I tried vacuuming up the fine material that had been cut. But because the PCB was too small, the vacuum cleaner picked up my PCB. So I had to reprint it.

                    <p>I spent some time to learn operational amplifier in final project. An operational amplifier (op amp or opamp) is a DC-coupled high-gain electronic voltage amplifier with a differential input and, usually, a single-ended output. More

                    <p>I chose to use TLV237x-Q1 550-µA/Channel, 3-MHz Rail-to-Rail Input and Output Operational Amplifiers. And here is the datasheet.</p>

                    </header>

                    <p>A piezoelectric transducer can be used either to transform an electric current to an acoustic pressure field or, the opposite, to produce an electric current from an acoustic field. These devices are generally useful for applications
                        that require the generation of sound in air and liquids. Examples of such applications include phased array microphones, ultrasound equipment, inkjet droplet actuators, drug discovery, sonar transducers, bioimaging, and acousto-biotherapeutics.
                        This example shows how to couple piezoelectric vibrations in a transducer to an acoustics pressure wave in a fluid such as air or water. The physics that are coupled and solved are piezoelectric stress-strain, an electric field,
                        and pressure acoustics in a fluid.</p>

                        The phone case is 3D printed, because the Pizeo part of the circuit is very dense, plus the pizeo circuit is lined up inside the phone case but the other circuit is lined up outside the phone case. In the design, I set the phone case into two parts, and
                        the two parts are not completely close, leaving room for wires to go through.

                        In order to facilitate the test of form factor design, besides printing the mobile phone case, I also 3D printed the mobile phone to test the fit degree of the case. In the middle of printing, I ran out of PLA, so I changed the PLA to another color and
                        continued printing.

                        I spent a lot of time on the line because a lot of pizeo was used, but the area of the phone case was small and the area taken up by removing the electronics left very little area for the line. I kept trying to arrage lines on scratch paper. After iterating
                        many times, I found a way to make it.

                    <p>
                        To test whether the microphone can sense the sound, I built a interface to visualize it. This interface visualizes a part of the functionality of the system (input device). The input sensors of this system are microphone, which can perceive the sound
                        of the environment. When designing the interface, I regard the strength of signal received by the microphone as the trigger mechanism of button. To be specific, the "microphone button" is triggered when the perceived sound exceeds
                        350 decibels.

                        The goal of the software is to control the vibration of the pizeo through changes in the sound signal. There are five rows of Pizeos on the hardware. The first two rows are controlled together, the middle row is controlled separately, and the last two
                        rows are controlled together.

                    <p>
                        The difficulty of software part is the frequency adjustment of analog signal. Arduino does not generate true analog outputs. The instantaneous output is always 0V or 5V. To create (mimic) an analog signal, the Arduino uses a technique called Pulse Width
                        Modulation (PWM). By varying the duty cycle, we can mimic an “average” analog voltage. But we cannot adjust the frequency directly. PWM Frequency in arduino is 490Hz.

                    <p>It was a great experience to take this class. I learned a lot and met a lot of interesting people. I am very grateful to TAs who helped me a lot on fabrication, especially the fabrication process which needs to use big machine.
